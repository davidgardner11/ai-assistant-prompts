I want you to refine this brainstorming document into a prompt for a deep research system that will be tasked with writing a technical spike
research document on a software engineering project. The goal of this research is to help guide future agentic coding systems into 
having a good understanding of the technical landscape around the software the user wants to create.

- read documentation
- read research papers and white papers 
- continually refine their research based on their findings
- create a deliverable (document) based on the user's request
