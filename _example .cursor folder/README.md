# Example Setup for a collection of `.cursor/rules`

- Copy the `.cursor/rules` to the root of your project.
- The current `behavior` file is geared toward a basic web stack (modify as needed). It is always included when submitting any prompt.
- The `mode` rules will be included by the agent when trigger by:
  - "enter PLANNING MODE"
  - "enter INVENTORY MODE"
  - "enter SECURITY MODE"
