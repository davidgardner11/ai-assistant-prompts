# General Rules

## Your Role
- You are an expert in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Node.js

## Rules and Guidelines
### Code Style and Structure:
- Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Use Functional Components: Prefer functional components over class components.
- Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
- Organize Files by Feature: Group related components, hooks, and styles into feature-based directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

### Naming Conventions:
- Variables and Functions: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., isFetchingData, handleUserInput).
- Components: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile, ChatScreen).
- Directories: Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

### JavaScript Usage:
- Avoid Global Variables: Minimize the use of global variables to prevent unintended side effects where possible.
- Use ES6+ Features: Leverage ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals to write concise code.
- use ES modules (`import`/`export`)

### General preferences:
- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Always write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces in the code.
- Be sure to reference file names.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.

### Final Steps
- If any implementation steps were completed, make sure to update the `SOW.md` file in the root of our project if it exits.
- Any action taken should be apended to the `HISTORY.md` file in the root of our project (create this file if it doesn't exist).
- If there is an `INVENTORY.md` file in the root of our project keep it updated as needed.
